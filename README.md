# Quick Start Guide

This is a website adapted from a quick start template. The actual guide is hosted on Github at [https://mikebranstein.github.io/azure-identity-workshop-instructions/](https://mikebranstein.github.io/azure-identity-workshop-instructions/). 

## Setup

To install and run the site locally, you can start by running `npm install` to install this templateâ€™s dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

And then run `gulp` to launch the guide in your browser:

```
$ gulp
```

Gulp starts up a development server and launches the quick start guide in it. Gulp also watches for changes to files in the `src` folder (including the chapter Markdown files), and refreshes the site in your browser automatically.
